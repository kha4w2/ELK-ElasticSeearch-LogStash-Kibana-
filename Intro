# 🚀 Windows-to-ELK Full Logging Pipeline
**Winlogbeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana**

This repository contains a complete, fully documented, end-to-end logging pipeline that collects, processes, and visualizes Windows event logs using the ELK Stack.  
The project is designed as a production-ready blueprint for building a centralized log management and monitoring environment.

---

## 📌 Overview

The pipeline integrates multiple Elastic components to create a seamless flow of logs:

- **Winlogbeat** – Collects Windows event logs  
- **Logstash** – Processes, filters, and enriches log data  
- **Elasticsearch** – Stores, indexes, and secures the logs  
- **Kibana** – Provides dashboards, visualization, and analysis  

This repository includes all installation steps, configuration files, verification commands, and security configurations needed to deploy the entire pipeline successfully.
